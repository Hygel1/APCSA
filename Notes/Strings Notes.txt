Chapter 8 - Strings

Key Terms:
Literal Strings
Immutability
cancatenation = Converting to and from Strings
Character class
StringBuffer - Blend between strings and arrays

String Class:
 - The java String API (online) gives you everything that can be done with Strings
 - Can use cancatination (+=)
 - Literal strings are the actual value held as the String value (defined directly by code)
    - Cannot be an actual variable (like user input)
 - Since strings are objects, we can use dot notation on them
 - Literal Strings can use escape characters (such as: "\n" for newline)

Immutability:
 - Once you create a String, it cannot be changed
 - None of the methods that exist in the String class can change the String
    - When Strings seem to be changed, they are actually creating new Strings
 - Strings are immutable to save memory when multiple Strings refer to the same information
    - references cannot be changes so there is no reason to duplicate data
 - Methods such as toUpperCase() creates a completely new String and throws away the original String
 - Empty Strings can be created with "" or new String()
    - Empty Strings are not the same as null Strings, whihc are effectively uninitialized

Methods:
    - length() returns the length of a given String
        - "Flower".length() would return 6
    - charAt(k) returns the Char value of the String at position k (starting from 0)
        - "Flower".charAt(2) would return 'o'
    - substring(i,j) returns the substring of chars from position i up to (but not including) j
        - "Flower".substring(1,4) would return "low"
        - The length of the returned substring is always (j-i)
        - This can also be called with only one int parameter
            - This returns from that value to the end of the String
            - "Flower".substring(2) would return "ower"
    - indexOf(int) returns the index of a specific char or String
        - "July 5, 2012 1:28:19 PM".indexOf("2") would return 8
            - returns the index of the firts instance of the value
        - Calling this method as indexOf(String, int) finds the first instance of the String starting at that index int
            - "July 5, 2012 1:28:19 PM".indexOf("2",9) would return 11
        - If the specified String or char value cannot be found, -1 is returned
        - lastIndexOf() is similar to indexOf() but it starts from the back rather than the front
    - Comparisons
        - .equals(String) returns a boolean representing whether or not the Strings are identical
    - Replacements
        - trim() returns a String having removed whitespace from either end of the original String
        - replace(oldCh, newCh) replaces every occurence of oldCh with newCh in the String
            - pairs with replaceFirst(), which only replaces the first occurence of oldCh with newCh
        - toUpperCase() returns a new String in all upper case
        - toLowerCase() returns a new string in all lower case
    - Concatenation:
        - Method that can be called by wither concat() or +=
        - ex: "Flower".concat(" is pretty");
        - ex: "Flower"+=" is pretty";
    - toString() converts an int or other data type to a String value
    - Integer.parseInt(int) and Double.parseDouble(double) take a String value and convert it to an int/double
        - if there is a problem, it can throw NumberFormatException, which can be handled by try{} catch(){}
    - Character Methods
        - isLetter(), isLetterOrDigit()
        Character.digit(ch, radix) and Character.forDigit() can be used to count beyond base 10 

StringBuffer()
    - Blend between Strings and arrays
        - Holds characters like a String but is mutable and contains a set number of values similar to an array
    - If created without a specified number of values, the default is 16
    - capacity(int) returns the available space for new values
    - setLength() sets the StringBuffer to be a specified length but will add null values into newly created spaces (if larger than original)
        - ensureCapacity(int) will ensure that the StringBuffer is at least as long as the given value
            - If the StringBuffer is alredy at least as long as the given value, nothing changes; If it is shorter, the StringBuffer is lengthened
        - trimToSize() will eliminate all null values by reducing the size of the StringBuffer
    - append(value) adds the given value to the end of the StringBuffer and increases the size if necessary
        - insert(int position, value) adds the given value to the StringBuffer at the position given(lengthening if necessary)
            - This pushes the value already at the given position back such that whatever occcurs at the position would then occur after the inserted value
