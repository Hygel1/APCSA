		// that you THINK might cause it problems.  Be sure that your tests are ones for which
		// you would be able to check their answers manually or visually!
		// TYPICAL PATTERN:  1. Create an instance with a constructor.
		//					 2. Output "state" of the object. Usually the toSring() method.
		//					 3. Activate a method that alters state or produces an answer.
		//					 4. Output "state" of object to show transformation or output results.
		
		//FOR AN EXAMPLE CONSIDER RECTANGLETESTER.JAVA
