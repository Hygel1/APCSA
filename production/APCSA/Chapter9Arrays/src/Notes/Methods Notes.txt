Chapter 9 - Methods

Key Terms:

Arrays:
- Arrays are just a set of contiguous memory
- Individual locations in an array are called elements
- Individual positoins are called indices
    - Element is the value, Index is the position
- can be referenced by naming the array, then placing the index being caled in brackets
    - indices go from 0 to length-1 (going outside of these boundaries throws an exception)
    - the index must just be an int value, which can be stated through an equatoin inside of the brackets
        - this can be as complicated as you want as long as it is both in range and returns an int
- Arrays are mutable but their length is not
- Arrays are helpful for refering to several pieces of similar information 
    - helps to organize and shorten code
    - Dirent access to eny element of an array (don't have to sort through it to find information)
- Arrays are technically objects but don't contain any methods
    - Initially set to null when created and not defined with values
- When creating primitive value Arrays (like ints), the default values are real
    - When creating Arrays of objects, the default values are null
- Arrays can be initialized without being fully constructed, leaving you with a null array without any length or elements
- Initialize an arry using something like (int[] values;) and declare it using something like (int[] values = new int[9];)
- Placing an item into a location in an array destroys the value that was previously in that location
