    - in this.method(), the java keyword "this" always refers to the active class
ArraysList Notes
    - Java tool with the purpose of helping us solve complicated problems
    - list with the abilities of a normal list (programming list)
    - There are ArrayLists and linked LinkedLists
    - Built using ArrayList<dataType> name = new ArrayList<dataType>();
        - eg. ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
            - names.add("Ben"); - .add(String) places the given string at the end of the list, adding another spot at the end
            - names.add("Cat");
            - names.add(0,"Amy"); - .add(int Index, String) places the given String at the given position, shifting everything down and adding indices accordingly
            - System.out.prinltn(names);
                - the ArrayList object has a toString built in, thich allows it to be printed without .toString()
            - This results in [Amy, Ben, Cat]
    - ArrayLists have size and capacity
        - ArrayLists start with a default capacity and a size of 0
            - there is nothing in the array (therefore size is 0) but there is an ability to add things into the list (therefore the capacity must me >0)
        - size is the amount of elements in the ArrayList
        - capacity is the maximum amount of elements that can be placed in the ArrayList
    - ArrayList has an indexOf() function that makes it easy to find things in the ArrayList
